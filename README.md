# Optical Tracking System using OptiTrack V120 Duo

This project is an Optical Tracking system using the OptiTrack camera hardware meant to be integrated into SlicerMorph (a [*3D Slicer*](https://download.slicer.org/) extension)
and replicate the functionality of old school mechanical digitizing pens with the optical tracking of a digitizing stylus. The project uses the [*OptiTrack V120 Duo*](https://optitrack.com/cameras/v120-duo/) 
camera system  as well as the [*Motive*](https://optitrack.com/software/motive/) data processing software.
